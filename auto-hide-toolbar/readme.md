# auto-hide-toolbar #

This project demonstrates how to show and hide the `Toolbar` (formallyy known as `ActionBar`) when scrolling.

- `QuickHideActivity` has the Toolbar show and hide fast and all the way when there is scroll motion.
- `SlowHideActivity` has the Toolbar show and hide as there is scroll motion, with speed matching that of the scroll.


Example code included:
- Header for `RecyclerView` (see RecyclerAdapter.java)
